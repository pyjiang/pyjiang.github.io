Indulekha Vijayasree is an incoming PhD student joining the Jiang Lab in the fall of 2025. She graduated with her Master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, India, majoring in Biology with a minor in Chemistry in 2024. Her diverse research experience includes yeast genetics under simulated microgravity and chiral photoswitchable macrocycles, along with various internships and assistantships. She is fascinated by mutational spectra and signatures and aspires to explore how genotype and environment interact to shape these patterns. When not in the lab, she can be found performing private concerts for an audience of one, reading in a café, or planning trips with friends that occasionally make it out of the group chat.
