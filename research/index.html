What are the evolutionary processes that give rise to the huge phenotypic diversity that we see today?
		This is an intricate question without a simple answer. On one hand, the existing evolutionary theory 
		can capture the evolutionary dynamics at the population level but usually ignores the cellular and developmental constraints. 
		On the other, it is impossible to include every molecular detail that we know to form an interpretable model 
		of evolution. My strategy to this problem is to use a few well-studied system in which the molecular detail are well studied,
		so that it is possible to build interepretable model of evolution on this system. Studying a particular system can sometimes 
		shed light on principles of evolution. That is why we use model organisms so that we can dive deep into both molecular and evolutionary questions.
