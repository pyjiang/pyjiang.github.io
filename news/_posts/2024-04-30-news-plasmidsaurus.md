We sent our first PCR sample to [plasmidsaurus] for sequencing today! Can't believe they can sequence 10kb (actually up to 25kb) linear fragments for $15, and we don't need cloning. They use the Nanopore long-read sequencing, with 99% accuracy. This is way cheaper than Sanger sequencing and way simpler, with little compromise in accuracy. Can't wait to get our results back.
