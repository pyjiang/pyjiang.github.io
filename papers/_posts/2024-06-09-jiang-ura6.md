# Abstract

URA3 is frequently used in the yeast community as the mutation target for 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) resistance. We identified a novel class of ura6 mutants that can grow in the presence of 5-FOA. Unlike ura3 mutants, ura6 mutants remain prototrophic and grow in the absence of uracil. In addition to 5-FOA resistance, we found that mutations to URA6 also confer resistance to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In total, we identified 50 unique missense mutations across 32 residues of URA6. We found that 27 out of the 32 affected residues are located in regions conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three clinically relevant pathogenic fungi. These findings suggest that mutations to URA6 present a second target for mutation screens utilizing 5-FOA as a selection marker as well as a potential mode of resistance to the antifungal therapeutic 5-FC.
